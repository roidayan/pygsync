A python script to synchronize google calendars with your symbian phone internal calendar.

what id does for now:
```
Copy events from any google calendar you choose to your phone.
todo: alot more..
```

how to use it:
```
currently just set username and if you want to use your operator wap/gprs gateway
you will need to configure their proxy, you can get it in the connection advanced settings.
now just go to Synchronize->test , it will ask you for your password and if everything is
working fine it will ask you which calendar to copy events from (it will list you the calendars you have). choose your calendar and thats it.
